# Predicting-Credit-Card-Approvals

Predicting Credit Card Application Approvals
Banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low credit scores or low income levels and etc for example. The task I wish to achieve from this notebook is to build an automatic credit card approval predictor using Data Analysis and Machine Learning. For this, I have: 1) Load and read the data

2) Perform data cleaning- deal with missing values, duplicate values

3) Data Preprocessing- converting non-numeric values to numeric, scaling the dataset values to best fit a Machine Learning algorithm and finally split the dataset into train and test data

4) Exploratory data analysis to build an intuition about model needed

5) Build a Machine Learning model that is able to predict if an individual credit card application is approved or reject

The dataset that I have picked is the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
